- Search should be separated from calendar selection in case user need to search for mail by subject
- Pagination Should be added to enhance user usability instead of continuous scrolling approach.
- Provide user multiple options of how he wants to inspect the body (Split Page, Show Popup, Navigate to mail body in a separate page).
